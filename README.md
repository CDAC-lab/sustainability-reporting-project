## Introduction

In response to the urgent global need for sustainable energy solutions, **LEAP** (La Trobe Energy AI Analytics Platform) serves as a powerful foundation for the Sustainability Reporting Project. Leveraging artificial intelligence and advanced analytics, LEAP integrates diverse energy and environmental datasets ranging from smart meter feeds and solar generation logs to weather patterns and emission records to provide a holistic, data-driven view of energy performance.

Building on historical research and data collected through LEAP, this project aims to develop an interactive **Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** designed specifically for energy sustainability. The dashboard will visualize vital metrics such as:

- **Energy consumption trends** across campus facilities  
- **Renewable energy generation**, including solar PV output  
- **Carbon emissions** tracked over time and benchmarked against sustainability targets  
- **AI-driven predictive insights** that forecast demand peaks and renewable contributions

By combining advanced analytics with a clear and accessible BI interface, the project empowers key stakeholders including facility managers and sustainability leaders to monitor performance, identify opportunities, and support evidence-based decision-making aligned with the university's long-term environmental goals.
